sm64pc Build * Install * Update Script

This directory is used to not only for the sm64pc program to store its config file and save files, but also for smlinux to do its internal updates.  Please do not delete the hidden .git folder if you wish to retain this functionality.

To run smlinux, just type smlinux at any command prompt, it should have installed to your path the first time you ran it.

If you have never ran it, chmod +x smlinux (or sometimes smlinux.sh if hosted somewhere that requires extensions) then run it, and will update and install itself.
